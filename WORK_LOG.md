Then, I made an optimization to the ladders and snakes arrays reducing its search time to O(1). I then wrote out a plan of what I wanted to do. |
| Sep 4 |  10-10:30am  | I spent this 30 minutes implementing BFS. I wrote code to try all 6 possible dice rolls and kept track of what I had visited in an array. I implemented logic at the beginning of the loop to determine if I had tried all permutations of a turn and increment moves. This code works for the first two test cases and fails on the third. |
