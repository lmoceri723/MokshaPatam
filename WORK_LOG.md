| Sep 3 | 9:30-10:00pm |                                                                                                  I started by researching BFS, as I recognized it as a good strategy to solve this problem. Then, I made an optimization to the ladders and snakes arrays reducing its search time to O(1). I then wrote out a plan of what I wanted to do. |
| Sep 4 |  10-10:30am  | I spent this 30 minutes implementing BFS. I wrote code to try all 6 possible dice rolls and kept track of what I had visited in an array. I implemented logic at the beginning of the loop to determine if I had tried all permutations of a turn and increment moves. This code works for the first two test cases and fails on the third. |
| Sep 6 | 7:05-7:35am  |                   I successfully got my BFS approach working. I started by realizing that I needed an extra loop to try all dice combinations instead of only one. I then realized that my indexing was inconsistent (0 vs 1 based) so I made my function treat everything as 0 based. These changes fixed my code and it passes all tests. |
